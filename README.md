# CS_224N_NLP-Course

This repository contains homeworks and final project of DeepPavlov Deep Learning for NLP course.

## Homework 1
The purpose of this assignment was to get familiar with PyTorch library. First sub-part was to implement flatten function of an input tensor. Meaning given an input tensor of shape N x C x H x W we want to return N x (C x H x W). Second sub-part was to implement foward pass of two-layer fully-connected ReLU network. And third part was to explore different types of PyTorch Module API
